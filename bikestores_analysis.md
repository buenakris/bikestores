## Disclaimer & Differences

The initial inspiration for the BikeStores data analysis project was created by _**Work the Data**_ Youtube channel and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pHYKdyRvrw).

A few key strategic decisions were made to change the technical stack used in Work the Data's tutorial. These decisions were based on Kris Buenaventura's personal technical stack & desired practice objectives.

A summary below:

- _**PostgreSQL**_ was used as the primary DBMS rather than _**MS SQL Server**_. This change necesitated a variety of syntax-related updates, such as:

```SQL
-- DDL for creating project tables

-- SQL Server syntax
CREATE TABLE production.categories (
	category_id INT IDENTITY (1, 1) PRIMARY KEY,
	category_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL
);

-- PostgreSQL syntax
CREATE TABLE production.categories (
	category_id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1) PRIMARY KEY,
	category_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL
);
```

Overall, these decisions to change the technical stack created interesting and beneficial challenges in ensuring that the end product remained the same despite the differences in technologies used.

## Understanding the Principles of Data Analysis

The core five components of any Data Analysis project involve:

1. _**Understand the problem.**_
   - Identify stakeholders and business requirements.
   - Define clear, measurable goals & objectives.
2. _**Collect and gather the data.**_
   - Identify data sources (database, API, flat-file, etc.)
   - Extract the data using data extraction tools.
3. _**Clean the data.**_
   - Handle any missing values or inconsistencies.
   - Normalize & transform the data.
4. _**Gather & analyze the data.**_
   - Test hypotheses using exploratory data tools.
   - Use a data visualization tool to identify patterns and insights.
5. _**Interpret the results.**_
   - Summarize key findings & insights.
   - Create a dashboard to present findings.
   - Create sound documentation on entire analysis methods used.

## Applying Data Analysis Principles to Sample Project

## PostgreSQL Database Setup

## Generating Dataset & Loading Dataset into Excel

In order to generate an effective dataset that will provide insights to all the clients' questions, we must query from the related tables that we had previously loaded.

This will require several `JOINs` among the related tables. The final SQL query can be found in the `dql_gen_dataset.sql` file.



This query also introduces two new aggregation columns, `TOTAL_UNITS_SOLD` and `REVENUE`. The calculations for those columns can be found below:

```SQL
    ...
	sum(ite.quantity) as total_units_sold,
	sum(ite.quantity * ite.list_price) as revenue
```

These aggregation columns will assist in providing additional insight in our future data analysis.
